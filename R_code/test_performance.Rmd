This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
test_performance = read_tsv("/Users/noa/Workspace/raxml_deep_learning_results/ready_raw_data/Pandit/ML/test_single_tree_data.tsv")
```


```{r}
test_performance %>% group_by(msa_path) %>% mutate(prob = (predicted_calibrated_failure_probabilities/max(predicted_calibrated_failure_probabilities)) %>% select (prob, is_global_max) %>% ggplot(aes(x=prob, y = as.factor(is_global_max)))+geom_boxplot()
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
