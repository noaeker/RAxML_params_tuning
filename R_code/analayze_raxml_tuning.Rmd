This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(lme4)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotrix)
library(visreg)
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
library(gridExtra)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(vip) 
library(plm)
```




```{r}
tuning_data<- read_tsv("/Users/noa/Workspace/raxml_deep_learning_results/tune_raxml.tsv")
```

```{r}
tuning_data %>% select (msa_name, starting_tree_ind,tree_type,spr_cutoff, spr_radius, run_name, final_ll,curr_starting_tree_best_ll,rf_from_curr_starting_tree_best_topology,delta_ll_from_curr_starting_tree_best_topology, best_msa_ll,
                        rf_from_overall_msa_best_topology,
                        delta_ll_from_overall_msa_best_topology) %>% filter (tree_type=='random',delta_ll_from_curr_starting_tree_best_topology==0, delta_ll_from_overall_msa_best_topology>0  )
```

```{r}

```





Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
