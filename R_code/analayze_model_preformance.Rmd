This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(survival)
library(survminer)
library(cmprsk)
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(survival)
library(survminer)
library(lubridate)
```


```{r}
model_performance = read_tsv("/Users/noa/Workspace/raxml_deep_learning_results/ready_raw_data/All_data/final_performance_comp.tsv")
model_performance<- model_performance %>% mutate (time_imprv = 20/total_actual_time, accuracy_diff =diff-mean_default_diff )
```








Efficiency

```{r}
model_performance %>% ggplot(aes(x=time_imprv)) + geom_histogram(color="darkblue", fill="lightblue")+
  labs(title="Running-time improvement between default cofnfiguration to ML-based tree search",x="Running-time improvement", y = "Count")+theme(axis.text=element_text(size=14),axis.title=element_text(size=14,face="bold"))
summary(model_performance %>% pull(time_imprv))
```




```{r}
model_performance %>% select (total_time_predicted, total_actual_time) %>% ggplot(aes(x=total_time_predicted, y = total_actual_time))+geom_point()
```


Accuracy

```{r}
model_performance %>% ggplot(aes(x=accuracy_diff)) + geom_histogram(color="darkblue", fill="pink")+
  labs(title="Log-likelihood difference between default cofnfiguration to ML-based tree search",x="Log-likelihood diff", y = "Count")+theme(axis.text=element_text(size=14),axis.title=element_text(size=14,face="bold"))

summary(model_performance %>% pull(diff))

summary(model_performance %>% pull(mean_default_diff))


```










Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
summary(train)
```
